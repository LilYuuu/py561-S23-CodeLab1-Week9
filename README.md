# Lily's HW 9: Data Structures

This assignment was highly dependent on the in-class list example. I used a list of flower names and asked users to input their favorite flower to see if it's in the list provided.

Question: Does the script have to be attached to a game object to run? I ran into this issue where I couldn't drag the text components onto the corresponding properties. But I fixed that after attaching to the script to the EventSystem Object.
